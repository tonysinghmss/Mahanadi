        My app will store data entered by you in your phone only.
        Also my app doesn\'t store your personal data anywhere else
        other than your phone.\n\n
        Read the above line again.\n\n
        Actually I don\'t have capacity or resources or capital 
        to do so.\n\n
        
        To make a living, I need some money.
        So my app will irritate you with some advertisements.\n\n
        
        Advertisements are provided by Google which works 
        in mysterious ways.\n\n
        You can always remove advertisements by paying a\n
        miniscule amount.\n\n
        
        If you trust this app with advertisements provided by \n
        Google, then click on Agree button.\n\n
        You can always reset the agreement from settings in home page and my app will
        delete everything about you stored in your phone and move on.
